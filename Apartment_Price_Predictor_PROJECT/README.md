# Moscow-apartment-price-predictor
This project combines data science , machine learning , and an interactive Streamlit web app  to predict apartment prices in Moscow based on area, metro station, and building type.  Unlike typical ML projects that rely on libraries like scikit-learn, this app uses a custom-built Linear Regression model implemented from scratch with NumPy .
